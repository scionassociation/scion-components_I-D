Then that SCION was developed  to meet these property requirements.\n3. Description of SCION minimal stack (this content is already there).\n4. Discussion of each property for each core component (I am not sure about the structure: whether to take the core components as upper level, and the properties as the lower level, or the other way around).\n-   For each property: how SCION achieves this property, in relation to the existing Internet. I think you can re-use all property content you already wrote, this is more a matter of re-organizing the content. \n5. I like the sections about SCION and Segment Routing/RPKI. I would add these sections after the above discussion, under \"Related work\" or something alike. Maybe also add sections on Semantic Routing/BGPsec?\n6.  You could finish the draft with the dependency analysis, which explains very nicely that the core components cannot really exist on their own (except maybe for the CP-PKI).\n7. I am not sure about the sections Transition Mechanisms and Additional Components. Regarding the Transition Mechanisms, I would either only mention SIG, or refer to \"my\" draft entirely.

Besides that, I could add even more. Something like: \n```\nThere are many use cases where existing protocols show the limitations of existing inter-domain routing approaches: \n- Cloud to customer connectivity:  \n- Enterprise communication: \n- ... \n```\n\nBut I'd update the other draft (where we already have a motivation paragraph), rather than having a \"duplicate\" motivation paragraph here. Thoughts?  \n\n\n\n_Code quote:_\n```Markdown\n## Design goals\nSCION was created from inception with the intention of providing the following properties for inter-domain communication.\n\n- *Availability*. SCION is meant to provide highly available communication. The focus is not only on handling failures (both on the last hop or anywhere along the path), but also on allowing communication in presence of adversaries.\nAvailability is fundamental as applications move to cloud datacenters and enterprises increasingly rely on Internet communication for mission-critical communication.\n\n- *Security*. SCION was designed by security researchers with the goal of making most network-based and routing attacks either impossible or easy to mitigate.\nSecurity means also offering end-hosts transparency and control over forwarding paths. In addition, SCION's design starts from the assumption that any two entities on the global Internet do not mutually trust each other.\nSCION therefore enables trust agility, allowing users to decide the roots of trust they wish to rely upon.\n\n- *Scalability*.  Security and high availability should not result in compromises on scalability.\nThe S in SCION, indeed, stands for scalability.\nThe goal is to achieve routing that scales with network growth, both in the control plane and in the data plane (forwarding should be as efficient as possible).\n```\n\n\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n",
